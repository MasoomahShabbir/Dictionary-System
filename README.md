# Dictionary-System
Dictionary Management System is a C++ console-based application that uses an AVL Tree technique to store words and their meanings. The self-balancing property of the AVL Tree ensures efficient searching, insertion, and traversal operations while maintaining words in alphabetical order with optimized time complexity.
